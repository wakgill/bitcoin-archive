It should be your Bitcoin address at home that you received it
with.  There's no way for it to know who it's from, so the best
it can do is tell which of your addresses it was received on.
You can create multiple addresses and give a different address
to each person and label them to help figure out who's sending
to you.

It doesn't know any names other than what you tell it.  The name
printed there is what's associated in your address book for that
address, either under the Address Book button or the "Change..."
button to the right of your Bitcoin address.
