The files are in "%appdata%\Bitcoin", that's the directory to
backup.  The data is stored in a transactional database DBM, so
it should be safe from loss if there's a crash or power failure.

%appdata% is per-user access privilege.  Most new programs like
Firefox store their settings files there, despite the headwind of
Microsoft changing the directory name with every Windows release
and being full of spaces and so long it runs off the screen.

Just now added code to the next release for that.
